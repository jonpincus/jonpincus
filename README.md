### Hiiiii!!!!! (waves) ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jon, he/him or they/them, a software engineer / entrepreneur / strategist and activist who focuses on justice, equity, diversity, inclusion, and intersectionality.  My current software project is https://thenexus.today, an anti-oppressive news aggregator.   I also consult for and advise tech companies like O.school, where Iâ€™m currently a Tech DIVA (Technical Diversity, Inclusion, and Values Advisor), and OPTYVA, where Iâ€™m Architect for Integrative Technologies + Communities.
